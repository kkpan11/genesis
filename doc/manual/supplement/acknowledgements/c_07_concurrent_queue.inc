## Concurrent Queue @anchor supplement_acknowledgements_code_reuse_concurrent_queue

Genesis contains an implementation of a Concurrent Queue and related classes:

  * @link genesis::utils::ConcurrentQueue ConcurrentQueue@endlink
  * @link genesis::utils::BlockingConcurrentQueue BlockingConcurrentQueue@endlink
  * @link genesis::utils::LightweightSemaphore LightweightSemaphore@endlink

This implementation is from the excellent moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue
(https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue), using version v1.0.4,
which was published under a simplified BSD license, and also dual-licensed under the Boost
Software License. The full [original license](https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue/blob/master/LICENSE.md), as of 2024-07-04, is copied below.

We adapted the original code by (roughly) formatting it to our formatting standard, as well as
renaming the namespace from moodycamel to be contained within our namespace, to keep our
documentation and usage consistent. Other than that, all functionality is kept as-is.
