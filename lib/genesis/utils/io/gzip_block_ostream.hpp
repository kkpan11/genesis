/**
 * @brief Output stream that writes blocks of gzip-compressed data to an underlying wrapped stream,
 * using parallel compression.
 *
 * The gzip format specifies that concatenated blocks of gzip-compressed data (including the gzip
 * header) are still valid gzip files, and are equivalent to concatenating the decompressed data.
 * This is for example used in compressed vcf files (.vcf.gz, Variant Calling Format) to achieve
 * random access into compressed data, by maintaining an index table of offsets to the beginning
 * of individual compressed blocks.
 *
 * We here use a similar technique to achieve a compression speedup by using parallel threads
 * on different gzip blocks. This gives almost linear speedup, at the cost of ~3% increase in
 * resulting file size due to the additional gzip headers of each block. This downside can be
 * alleivated by using larger blocks though. By default, we use 64kB blocks.
 *
 * Exemplary usage:
 *
 *     // Wrapped output stream to write to. Use binary mode, so that compressed output works.
 *     std::ofstream ofile;
 *     ofile.open( "path/to/test.txt.gz", std::ios_base::binary );
 *
 *     // Prepare stream
 *     GzipBlockOStream ostr( ofile );
 *
 *     // Write data to stream
 *     ostr << "some data\n";
 *
 * By default, the global thread pool of Options::get().global_thread_pool() is used for compressing
 * gzip blocks in parallel. An alternative pool can be provided instead if needed.
 *
 * Furthermore, note that some file managers might not display the original (uncompressed) file size
 * correctly when viewing the resulting gz file, as they might use only the size of one block
 * instead of the full resulting uncompressed file size. This should not affect decompression or any
 * other downstream processes though. As this class is a stream, we usually do not know beforehand
 * how lare the resulting file will be, so there is not much we can do about this.
 *
 * The class could also be extended in the future to achieve indexing similar to compressed vcf.
 * NB: We have not yet tested compatibility with the vcf format, as they might employ additional
 * tricks to achieve their goals.
