/**
 * @brief Type erasure for iterators, using std::function to eliminate the underlying input type.
 *
 * This class offers an abstraction to get a uniform iterator type over a set of underlying iterators
 * of different type. It expects a function (most likely, you want to use a lambda) that converts
 * the underlying data into the desired type T, which is where the type erasure happens.
 * The data that is iterated over is stored here, and the end of the iterator is indicated by the
 * lambda by returning `false`.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ~~~{.cpp}
 *     // Convert from an iterator over VcfRecord to Variant.
 *     auto beg = vcf_range.begin();
 *     auto end = vcf_range.end();
 *
 *     // Create the conversion with type erasure via the lambda function.
 *     auto generator = GenericInputStream<Variant>(
 *         [beg, end]( Variant& var ) mutable {
 *             if( beg != end ) {
 *                 var =  convert_to_variant(*beg);
 *                 ++beg;
 *                 return true;
 *             } else {
 *                 return false;
 *             }
 *         }
 *     );
 *
 *     // Iterate over generator.begin() and generator.end()
 *     for( auto const& it : generator ) ...
 * ~~~
 *
 * For other types of iterators, instead of `beg` and `end`, other input can be used:
 *
 * ~~~{.cpp}
 *     // Use a pileup iterator, which does not offer begin and end.
 *     auto it = SimplePileupInputIterator( utils::from_file( pileup_file_.value ), reader );
 *     auto generator = GenericInputStream<Variant>(
 *         [it]( Variant& var ) mutable {
 *             if( it ) {
 *                 var = *it;
 *                 ++it;
 *                 return true;
 *             } else {
 *                 return false;
 *             }
 *         }
 *     );
 * ~~~
 *
 * And accordingly for other underlying iterator types.
 *
 * In addition to the type `T` that we iterate over, for user convenience, we also offer to use
 * a data storage variable of the template type `D` (typedef'd as GenericInputStream::Data).
 * This data is provided at construction of the GenericInputStream, and can be accessed via the
 * @link GenericInputStream::data() data()@endlink functions.
 * it is a generic extra variable to store iterator-specific information.
 * As the GenericInputStream is intended to be initializable with just a lambda function that yields
 * the elements to traverse over, there is otherwise no convenient way to access related information
 * of the underlying iterator. For example, when iterating over a file, one might want to store
 * the file name or other characteristics of the input in the data().
 *
 * The class furthermore offers filters and transformations of the underlying iterator data,
 * using the functions add_filter(), add_transform(), and add_transform_filter(), which can all be
 * mixed and are executed as a combined list in the order in which they were added using these
 * three functions (that is, it can be first a filter, then a transformation, then a filter again).
 * This allows to easily skip elements of the underlying iterator without the need to add an
 * additional layer of abstraction.
 *
 * As an additional layer of convenience, the class offers observers for each element, as well as
 * callbacks for the beginning and end of the iteration. Those are meant as simplifications to
 * reduce code duplcation in user code, and can be used in combination with each other. For example,
 * a observer can be added that (via a lambda capture) counts statistics of the elements being
 * processed, and those can then be reported at the end of the iteration. This could of course also
 * be achieved by adding this functionatlity in the loop body and at the loop end when running
 * this iterator. However, for example in our tool https://github.com/lczech/grenedalf, we have
 * setup functions for a GenericInputStream (of type VariantInputStream) that are re-used across
 * commands. Then, instead of having to have code duplication or repeated function calls in those
 * commands, we only need to add the callbacks in the shared code that creates the iterator,
 * and they are used in every command automatically.
 *
 * Lastly, the class offers block buffering in a separate thread, for speed up. This capability
 * takes care of the underlying iterator processing (including potential file parsing etc),
 * and buffers blocks of elements, so that the user of this class has faster access to it.
 * For example, when processing data along a genome with lots of computations per position,
 * it makes sense to run the file reading in a separate thread and buffer positions as needed,
 * which this class does automatically. This can be activated by setting the block_size() to the
 * indended number of elements to be buffered. By default, this is set to 0, meaning that no
 * buffering is done. Note that small buffer sizes can induce overhead for the thread
 * synchronisation; we hence recommend to use block sizes of 1000 or greater, as needed.
 *
 * We are aware that with all this extra functionality, the class is slighly overloaded, and that
 * the filters and the block buffering would typically go in separate classes for modularity.
 * However, we are taking user convenience and speed into account here: Instead of having to add
 * filters or a block buffer wrapper around each input iterator that is then wrapped in a
 * GenericInputStream anyway, we rather take care of this in one place; this also reduces levels of
 * abstraction, and hence (hopefully) increases processing speed.
 *
 * @see VariantInputStream for a use case of this iterator that allows to traverse different
 * input file types that all are convertible to @link genesis::population::Variant Variant@endlink.
